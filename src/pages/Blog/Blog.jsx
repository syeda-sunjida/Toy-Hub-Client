        Access Token: An access token is a credential that is issued to a user after a successful authentication process. It represents the users authorization to access specific resources or perform certain actions on a server or an API. Access tokens are typically short-lived and have an expiration time. They are used to authenticate API requests by including them in the request headers.

        Refresh Token: A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is also issued during the authentication process. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are not sent with each API request. Instead, they are used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires. Refresh tokens are securely stored on the client-side and are sent to the server to request a new access token when needed.

        To store access tokens and refresh tokens on the client-side, you have a few options:

        Cookies: You can store tokens as HTTP-only cookies, which are not accessible by JavaScript code. This approach provides some level of protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

        Local Storage: Another option is to store tokens in the browsers local storage. However, this method is vulnerable to XSS attacks since the tokens can be accessed by JavaScript code.

        Session Storage: Similar to local storage, session storage can be used to store tokens. However, the tokens are only available for the duration of the users browsing session and are cleared when the session ends.

        2.ans: <br /> Comparing SQL and NoSQL databases:

        SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a relational data model and use SQL for data definition, manipulation, and retrieval. They provide a predefined schema, support for transactions, and enforce ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. SQL databases are ideal for applications with complex relationships and structured data, such as financial systems or inventory management.

        NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. They offer flexible schemas and are horizontally scalable, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data, high traffic, and distributed environments. NoSQL databases are often used in modern web applications, real-time analytics, and scenarios where the schema may evolve over time.

        3.ans: <br /> Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of robust features and middleware for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and integrating with various middleware and databases.

        NestJS is a progressive, extensible framework for building server-side applications with Node.js. It is built on top of Express.js and offers an opinionated structure and a powerful dependency injection system. NestJS promotes the use of TypeScript and follows the principles of modular architecture, making it suitable for building scalable and maintainable applications.
 
        MongoDBs aggregate function is a powerful tool for data aggregation and processing in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It allows you to perform complex operations on collections of documents, including grouping, filtering, sorting, joining, and performing calculations. The aggregate function uses a pipeline approach, where multiple stages are chained together to process the data. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data, transforming and reshaping it according to your requirements. The pipeline stages can include operations like $match, $group, $sort, $project, and many others, allowing you to perform sophisticated data manipulations and analysis in MongoDB.
